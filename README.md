This version Have a error,
when timer stops the timescale is set to  as making the game pause
when hit by another knife the game also stops
But when user clicks the restart button that shows up upon after get hit by another knife the game works as intended
But when the timer stops and user press the restart button the timescale never changes but the game is active.
Both the buttons are the same.
It also have the resume function attached but it never works.
This is the one and only erroe i faced till now
There is no other error,
